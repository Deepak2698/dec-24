Why we need React.js ?

- Every time a user clicks on the url a new request gets send to the browser and a new html (dom) gets loaded.
- But, when we use react the html file is loaded only once
- After that the components are getting changed.

* When the components are getting changed we need some link

-Routing

M - Models (data/database)
V - View    (Routes/FE)
C - Controllers (backend)


FE ------> BE  ------> DB -> Promise {resolved,rejected and pending}

Components are jsx

<Router>
    <Routes>
        <Route path = '' element = {<jsx-component>}
        <Route path = '' element = {<jsx-component>}
        <Route path = '' element = {<jsx-component>}
    <Routes/>
<Router/>
